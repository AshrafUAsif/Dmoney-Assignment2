# Dmoney-Assignment2 automation by postman & newman

## About this project:


### D-money is a financial-related demo project created for transferring money virtually in a fake environment. In this project, I have automated the D-money API using Postman and Newman. Here, I have covered 
1. The administrator creates an agent and two customers at random. using the administrator's email and password.
2. Deposit some money from the SYSTEM account to the agent. System account: SYSTEM (range 10 tk to 10000 tk)
3. Agent deposit to any one customer
4. Check agent balance
5. Then withdraw any amount paid by the customer from the agent (ranging from 10 tk to 10000 tk)
6. Then the customer checks the balance
7. Then send money to the other customer
8. Then from another customer payment to this merchant: 01686606905
9. Then the second customer will check both the balance and statement
10. Then the merchant will check his own balance
